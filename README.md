# Energiser
Energiser allows users to search for charging points for their electric vehicles. It displays nearby charge points on a map and allows users to search locations around the world for charge points. Information on each charge point such as number of charging sockets and whether or not the charger is vacant is also presented to the user (data may not be accurate). When a charge point is selected, users can also see suggestions of things to do while the wait for their car to charge, such as cafes and restaurants. Users can also filter their charge point results by the type of charger available, the price per kW and the number of available sockets.
